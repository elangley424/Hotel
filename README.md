/* Your application should use all four of the collections data types we covered: â€¢ Arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps, HashSets

*/

// Get available room list // welcome the user, ask how many beds, show available rooms

//rooms will be its own class file (roomInfo.java) (can use has-a relationship) //generate room number, like 103 305 506

// (Example) Two Bed rooms: // 1st floor: 10 rooms are available // 2nd floor: 10 rooms are available // 3rd floor: 10 rooms are available // 4th floor: 10 rooms are available // 5th floor: 10 rooms are available

// create conditional for rooms if they pick a category that has no rooms available: // print out a statement that says there isnt any available // just like the inclass library example

//inform user of the price(seperate class priceInfo.java //(different price for each floor, and different beds)

//get user info, get payment info //name, billing address, email

// confirm room reservation, print recipt // conditional makes the room unavailable (through a loop)
